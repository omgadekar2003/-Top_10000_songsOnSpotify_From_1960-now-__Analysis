# -Top_10000_songsOnSpotify_From_1960-now-__Analysis

I have a passion for music and have explored various genres over time. I'm curious about how songs are analyzed and what criteria are used to label them as the "Best/Top Songs of All Time." Spotify, for instance, often declares the best/top songs of all time based on attributes of data such as track details, album information, audio features, and content attributes. Understanding how these elements are analyzed and interpreted helps us appreciate the complexity of music data analysis.
